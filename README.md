# Explore-and-Summarize-White-Wine-Quality-Data
This project is a part of Udacity Data analyst Nanodegree Program.

Datasets to be explored corresponds to a white wine samples of different  variants of portuguese “Vinho Verde”. 
Inputs include objective tests (i.e. Alcohol, Density, PH values) and the output is based on sensory data (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts). Each expert graded the wine quality between: 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

For more information: [Cortez et al., 2009].

The purpose of this project was to do preliminary exploration of wine data, with a goal of selecting right attributes which would lead to better wine quality.
Since the data was already in tidy structure, not much attention was payed in data wrangling, but finding relationships among the attributes and between attributes and the wine quality.
